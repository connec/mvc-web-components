View
	Template parsing... (tricky).

Testing
	More aesthetically appealing, maybe use Ruby's 'should' system, e.g.
	public function should_ensure_some_stuff_happens() {}

Useful Helpers Functions
	View rendering, focus on easily rendering partials.
	Redirecting.
	Various links (images, stylesheets, urls etc).
	(Maybe) HTML generation.
	Common form tools (default field values).

General/Misc/Unknown
	Easy pagination
