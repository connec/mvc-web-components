View
	Global assignment to View of useful framework helpers (Register, HTML generator, path generators, partial view rendering).
	Assignment of default paths to View (to void using views_dir (or whatever) manually every time).

	Improved sandboxing.
	Template parsing... (tricky).

	Redirecting.
	Various links (images, stylesheets, urls etc).
	(Maybe) HTML generation.
	Common form tools (default field values).

Model
	Easy access to total row count.

General/Misc/Unknown
